	<h2> THAT'S WHAT MAKES YOU BEAUTIFUL </h2>
	<p> You're insecure </p>
	<p>Don't know what for </p>
	<p>You're turning heads when you walk through the door </p>
	<p>Don't need make-up to cover up </p>
	<p>Being the way that you are is enough </p>
	<p>Everyone else in the room can see it </p>
	<p>Everyone else but you </p>
	<p>Baby, you light up my world like nobody else </p>
	<p>The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed </p>
	<p>But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell </p>
	<p>You don't know, oh oh </p>
	<p>You don't know you're beautiful </p>
	<p>If only you saw what I can see </p>
	<p>You'll understand why I want you so desperately </p>
	<p>Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe</p>
	<p>You don't know, oh oh </p>
	<p>You don't know you're beautiful, oh oh </p>
	<p>That's what makes you beautiful </p>
