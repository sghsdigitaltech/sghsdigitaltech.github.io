will begun promptly at 5:00pm. Students are reminded that attendance is a privilege and as such it is mandatory.
Due to a large amount of students skipping the recital last week the punishment for not attending has been increased. </p>

<p> Last week after Mrs Bass' mathematics class a one metre wooden ruler has gone missing. This is a vital piece
of learning equipment and it is very important that we are able to locate this and return it to the classroom
promptly. Any students that are able to provide information as to its whereabouts will be rewarded. </p>
