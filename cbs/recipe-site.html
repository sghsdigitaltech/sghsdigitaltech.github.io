<h1> Southern Sushi </h1>
<p> Back when I was 14 I used to spend my time in maths class reading comic books under the desk. One of my
favourite comic books was actually from Japan, a type of comic book known as Manga, and it was about a hard
working teenager who finds a magical notebook. What I loved most about this story was how it showed me all
about japanese culture. And in particular about Japanese food! I grew up in a small town in the North Island
though so I never had a chance to try Japanese food. </p>
<p> When I moved to Invercargill one of the things that people kept going on about was how I had to try some
'Southern Sushi' and I was so excited to finally get to try some Japanese food after all these years. I tried
ordering some at a couple of restaurants and I didn't have any luck until one day I was at a cafe and it was
on the menu so I of course had to try it. I was hungry and I was excited until the food appeared and I was
disappointed. This wasn't sushi at all! Where was the rice? Where was the seaweed? Where was the slivers of
avocado and strips of chicken? </p>
<p> My mumma always taught me to eat what you order though so I tried it and it was kinda already. But I went
home with a determination to do better. So I present to you my recipe for Southern Sushi </p>
