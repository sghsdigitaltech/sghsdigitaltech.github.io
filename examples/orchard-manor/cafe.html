<h2 style="color: #FA6033; text-align: center"> History </h2>
<p style="padding-left: 5%; padding-right: 5%;"> The Orchard Manor cafe is named after the grounds upon which it was built. Until 1975, the grounds was home to one of New Zealand's largest
private orchards, owned by an overseas family who lived in the manor each summer. In 1974 they went broke under mysterious circumstances and were forced to sell
the grounds. Local woman Hannah Jenkins bought the orchard and converted it into the cafe that stands there today!
